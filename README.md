# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose for the data analysis is to assist our friend in opening up a surf shop in Hawaii. We took data from a sqlite data base, made a 

connection through code and performed analysis of the data for the months of June and December. We then used the pandas function, 

describe, to discover the summary statistics for the month of June and December. 

## Results

  - June temperatures have a lower standard deviation, therefore the is less fluctuation in the temperatures in June than there is in July.
  
  - Temperatures a very close in the summary stats. Leads me to think that December also has very nice weather. It just gets a few 
  
  degrees colder that in June.
  
  - It stays warm in Hawaii year round
  
  ## Report
  
  ### Findings
  
  From the statistical analysis one can see that Hawaii has great weather. Great enough for someone to invest in a surf shop.
  
  Looking at the statistical summary stats there is slight differences in the weather when comparing June and December. June has a lower
  
  standard deviation in temperatures when compared to December. That said, December still has nice weather, the max high is only two 
  
  degrees less than the max high in June. What the summary stats tell us is that December has a few more days of colder lows but 
  
  overall we do not see a huge change in weather. 
  
  ### Recommendations
  
  I have two recommendations for further analysis. While we have a good data set I think we could look back further in history. Global
  
  warming is a concern to everyone. It would be interesting to see if there has been a shift in the summary stats when including more
  
  historical data. This could help us predict future weather to see if this is a location worth investing in. Second, since we are looking
  
  to invest in a surf shop. We could do a similar analysis on wave data. What areas of the ideal surfing conditions other than the
  
  temperature.
